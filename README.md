This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates an example of an infinite loop.  The bug.java file contains code with an infinite loop due to a missing or incorrect loop termination condition. The bugSolution.java file provides a corrected version that avoids the infinite loop by implementing proper loop control.  This example highlights the importance of carefully designing loop conditions to prevent unexpected program behavior.
